        <h4>
            Write about Visual Code Studio.
        </h4>
        <p>
            Out-of-the-box, Visual Studio Code includes basic support for most common programming languages. 
            This basic support includes syntax highlighting, bracket matching, code folding, and configurable snippets.
             Visual Studio Code also ships with IntelliSense for JavaScript, TypeScript, JSON, CSS, and HTML, as well as debugging support for Node.js.
              Support for additional languages can be provided by freely available extensions on the VS Code Marketplace.

        <h4>
            Write about the console screen, why it is used and how to open console screen and print anything on console.
        </h4>
        <p>

            You should use the console. log() method to print to console JavaScript.
             The JavaScript console log function is mainly used for code debugging as it makes the JavaScript print the output to the console.
             To open the browser console, right-click on the page and select Inspect, and then click Console.
